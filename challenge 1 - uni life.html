I go to <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Napier University </a > in Scotland.
<br> 
Currently I am in my second year, studying <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-web-design-and-development-undergraduate-fulltime"
>Web Design and Development.</a > 
</p >

I started University at 16 which is pretty young, in my first year I lived in student accommodation. 
Which was nice because I got to experience living without my family which I miss. 
<br> 
Because of COVID-19, I never actually finished first year because we got automatical pass our modules which was a life saver, 
because I had no hope in myself. 
Also because of COVID-19 I had to move back home with my family, and do my second year at home, which I hate, like with a passion.
